 <h2>About me</h2>
    <p class="aText">
      Hey there! I’m a computer science student studying at Delta College, planning to move on to Michigan Tech in the next few years to finish my degree. 
      I’ve always loved learning how things work whether that’s writing code, messing around with a bit of electronics, or even trying stuff with ham radio. 
      I like to dabble in quite a lot of things, sometimes I jump from one thing to another without properly finishing something.
      I’m also a proud brother of Delta Upsilon, a huge Star Wars fan, and a heavy metal enthusiast. 
      When I’m not studying or working on projects, you can usually find me gaming or reading up on some nerd stuff, or blasting my favorite metal bands.
      In short, I am just someone who loves learning, creating, and exploring whatever catches my curiosity.
